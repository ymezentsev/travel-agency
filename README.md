4. Type of tour
5. Type of transfer
6. Hotel type
7. Status (registered, paid, canceled)
8. Arrival ate
9. Eviction date

Tour can also be hot.

`User` must have personal account, which contains information about him (name, surname, balance, email, [optional]
password), as well as a list of selected tours and their current status.
